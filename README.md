# Inxtify

![Preview](preview.png)

A native, full-featured Instagram client for macOS.

## Overview

**Inxtify** was a tool I created for macOS back in 2016, which was used by many creatives, artists and marketing specialists for them to take the advantage of advance tools on their macOS such as Photoshop and DSLR images. It was later on shutdown by Apple forcefully without clear details due to Facebook's legal claim. Thus it's not recommanded to use any part regarding this project for any application meant to be sold on Apple's App Store.

This project was modified from its original form for public release, out-of-date and should not be used in any commercial purpose. There'll be no support for this project what-so-ever.

### Requirements

- Xcode 8.3.3 or later.
